  abstract: >
    In this tech blog we introduce the concept of Systems Modelling — and why it is such a powerful tool for charting a 
    robust pathway to net-zero. In Part 1, we discuss how a systems model is designed and optimised, 
    and some of the limits to these tools. In Part 2, we prepare a systems model from scratch 
    for a sector-coupled steel supply chain.
