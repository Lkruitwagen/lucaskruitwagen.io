    Climate change risks manifest in the real economy, with grave consequences for welfare of human populations and the biosphere; 
    the economic returns of industrial sectors; and geopolitical stability. Understanding the diffusion of risks in real infrastructure networks 
    is an urgent priority for delivering climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resiliency. The oil, gas, and coal supply chains are the most 
    salient progenitors and inheritors of these environmental risks. We prepare a geospatial arrangement of the global oil, gas, and coal supply chains 
    using open-source asset-level data. The resulting complex network has 6.09mn nodes and 15.70mn edges and is implemented in a graph database. 
    With estimates of annual coal, gas, and oil demand in 13,229 global population centres and 8,165 global power stations, we use a minimum-cost 
    flow method to estimate global asset-level energy flows. We develop a method for cross-validating and tuning our network flow simulation using 
    aggregate country-level import and export statistics. We demonstrate two analyses of asset-level transition risk: a counter-factual demand shock 
    scenario consistent with the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario; and supply shock scenarios developed by interdicting regionally-aggregated coal, 
    oil, and gas supplies. Our contribution lies in the global scope of our asset-level supply chain and the novelty of our minimum-cost flow method. 
    We conclude with a discussion of further research directions and make the graph database and supporting code publicly available.

    By 2050, over half the world's population will live in water-stressed areas. 
    Medium-term drought forecasting can help planners avoid ``day-zero'' events and adapt to climate change. 
    Machine learning-based precipitation-runoff modelling enables the prediction of surface water flow using only the meteorological record of a water basin.
    In this work, we extend a Bayesian LSTM precipitation-runoff model with graph convolutions based on hydrological basin adjacency to predict reservoir water 
    availability for sixty-six reservoirs in India. Employing a "sequence-to-sequence-to-sequence" model allows predictions to be based on the combination of 
    meteorological forcing data and ex-ante forecast data while producing predictions to a ninety-day future horizon. On a held-back test set of daily reservoir 
    water availability changes, we achieve a coefficient of determination of 0.372 for the maximum likelihood estimate for the 1-to-5 day horizon averaged across 
    all sites, which reduces to 0.337 for the 75-to-90 day horizon. We also find that removing the graph convolutional layer increases mean performance by 0.82 
    percentage points over the same horizons. This work represents the winning submission of the Wave2Web hackathon; the code and data is publicly available and 
    near-real-time predictions are available at h2ox.org.

    Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy generating capacity has grown by 41 per cent per year since 2009. Energy system projections that mitigate climate change and 
    aid universal energy access show a nearly ten-fold increase in PV solar energy generating capacity by 2040. Geospatial data describing the energy system 
    are required to manage generation intermittency, mitigate climate change risks, and identify trade-offs with biodiversity, conservation and land protection 
    priorities caused by the land-use and land-cover change necessary for PV deployment. Currently available inventories of solar generating capacity cannot fully 
    address these needs. Here we provide a global inventory of commercial-, industrial- and utility-scale PV installations (that is, PV generating 
    stations in excess of 10 kilowatts nameplate capacity) by using a longitudinal corpus of remote sensing imagery, machine learning and a large cloud computation 
    infrastructure. We locate and verify 68,661 facilities, an increase of 432 per cent (in number of facilities) on previously available asset-level data. With the 
    help of a hand-labelled test set, we estimate global installed generating capacity to be 423 gigawatts (−75/+77 gigawatts) at the end of 2018. Enrichment of our 
    dataset with estimates of facility installation date, historic land-cover classification and proximity to vulnerable areas allows us to show that most of the PV 
    solar energy facilities are sited on cropland, followed by aridlands and grassland. Our inventory could aid PV delivery aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals.

    Large amounts of imagery and data are produced every day by an ever growing multitude of
    earth observation satellites. The potential to apply Deep Learning methods is enormous, but depends 
    largely on the availability of corresponding labeled data. Developed regions such as Europe
    and North America have organizational structures that have collected crop data for many decades,
    however, these archives of data are not available in less developed regions, such as Eastern Africa.
    Labels in agriculture related applications are specially hard to obtain, requiring surveys as in general
    the crop type or state can not be determined from mid resolution satellite imagery. The surveys
    require a large amount of people and resources rending them costly. For this reason, it is not simple 
    to deploy sampling campaigns. Therefore, obtaining rich semantic information from the large
    amount of unlabelled data would reduce the cost of exploiting the satellite imagery and enable less
    developed countries to exploit temporal crop information. Self supervised methods seek to generate
    embeddings (lower dimensional representations) with designed invariances. In this work, we explore
    invariances appropriate to agriculture and crop classifiction e.g. invariances within seasons, regions
    and crops. However, we encounter multiple challenges in this process. Existing tools are limited for
    multiband timeseries data extraction and consolidation at a scale, making it time consuming to generate 
    large datasets for the purpose of self-supervised tasks. Also, training models to capture specific
    invariances and evaluating the validity of these invariances is hard. In this document we capture
    the different learnings of generating self-supervised embeddings that are relevant for crop detection
    and classification including: current literature on the subject, a method to generate large multiband
    and multitemporal datasets in a fast manner and different methods to learning embeddings of single
    image and timeseries of images for the purpose of detection and classification of crops.

    Earth observation offers new insight into anthropogenic changes to nature, and how these changes are effecting (and are effected by) 
    the built environment and the real economy. With the global availability of medium-resolution (10-30m) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) 
    Sentinel-1 and multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery, machine learning can be employed to offer these insights at scale, unbiased to the 
    reporting of companies and countries. In this paper, I introduce DeepSentinel, a data pipeline and experimentation framework for 
    producing general-purpose semantic embeddings of paired Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. I document the development of an extensible 
    corpus of labelled and unlabelled imagery for the purposes of sensor fusion research. With this new dataset I develop a set of experiments 
    applying popular self-supervision methods and encoder architectures to a land cover classification problem. Tile2vec spatial encoding with 
    a self-attention enabled ResNet model outperforms deeper ResNet variants as well as pretraining with variational autoencoding and contrastive 
    loss. All supporting and derived data and code are made publicly available.

    Marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds cover a vast area of the world’s oceans. 
    In doing so, they reflect a large portion of incoming solar radiation, and so have a significant cooling impact on
    the planetary energy budget. Even a small change in the properties of these cloud decks could have significant impacts on future climate change. 
    Aerosols (particulate pollutants suspended in the atmosphere) interact with clouds by forming condensation nuclei which cloud droplets form around. 
    Using observations from EUMETSAT’s MSG SEVIRI imager over the Southern Atlantic Ocean, we aim to better understand the aerosol impact on cloud structure
      through the application of multiple machine learning methods.

    The simultaneous expansion and decarbonisation of the global power sector is imperative for
    achieving the mutually dependent goals of poverty alleviation and the mitigation of climate
    change. Substantial policy and cost reductions in renewable generating options over the period
    of 2007 to 2017 were met with a three-fold increase in global renewable generating capacity.
    If sufficient renewable generating capacity is to be deployed to meet sustainable development
    goals, early evidence of the dynamics thereof might be captured in this period.
    Asset-level data sets of the global power sector have been obtained from S&P Market
    Intelligence for the years 2007 through 2017. Power sector assets, companies, and countries
    are arranged into a series of bipartite social networks for three fuel classes: fossil fueled
    generation, low-carbon (nuclear and hydro) generation, and renewable generation. Bipartite
    networks are projected on both company are country nodes to create directed networks. Basic
    network properties are analysed over time to reveal basic trends in the emergence of
    renewable generating options. The network analysis confirms that the ongoing energy
    transition is one of paradigmatic insurgency rather than steady evolution. Renewable
    generating companies are smaller and operate in more countries than incumbent fossil fuel
    and low-carbon competitors. The country projection is analysed using a fixed effect model to
    identify peer effects on the adoption of renewable generating options. Peer effects on the
    adoption of renewable generating options given the fixed effect model as currently developed
    are found to be insignificant.

    tied to company ownership information. Remote sensing (and related technological developments such as machine learning) can help

  abstract: >
    Thermal coal-fired power stations currently provide approximately 40% of the world's electricity and 30% of the world's generating capacity. 
    Approximately 83% of all coal demand is thermal coal, and 61% of primary coal energy is consumed in power stations. 
    Notwithstanding alternatives in coal gasification, coal-to-liquids, and chemical looping technologies, the future of coal in the 21st century depends 
    largely on the future of coal combustion for power generation. This chapter provides a technical overview of coal-fired power stations and their exposure 
    to a wide array of environment-related risks, including greenhouse gas emissions and stranded assets; water consumption and competition with agriculture, 
    industry, and domestic uses; climate stresses induced by anthropogenic climate change (of which they are the primary cause); competition with renewables 
    and generating flexibility; costs and trade-offs of mitigation options; retrofitability with carbon capture and storage; and the availability of finance. 
    The future of coal in the 21st century depends largely on the response of policy makers, industry and the concerned public to these risks.

    Engagement between investors and corporate boards has been suggested as a pathway to mitigate stranded asset and climate change risks. 
    Debate is ongoing as to whether divestment or active ownership strategies are more appropriate to deliver long-term value and environmental sustainability. 
    The paper tests the effectiveness of owner engagement strategies by studying the conditions for cooperation between investors and their companies. 
    Characteristics of investors and companies are modelled in game theoretic frameworks, informed by semi-structured interviews with professionals from the energy and finance industries, and academia, NGO, and regulatory sectors. 
    Conditions for mutual cooperation between investors and companies are characterized as prisoners’ dilemmas. A number of parameters are examined for their impact on the development of sustained cooperative equilibria, including: 
    the benefits and costs of cooperation; the degree of strategic foresight; individual discount factors; and mutual history. 
    Challenges in the formation of investor coalitions are characterized and solutions are proposed.

    mitigating environment-related risk in the thermal coal value chain. We present the findings of this report and comment on the role CCS might play in the thermal coal value chain as a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation technology for coal-fi red power stations and for emerging coal-processing technologies.

    Major oil and gas companies face an existential threat from the transition to a low-carbon economy consistent

    This paper identifies key uncertainties in the transition of oil and gas company business models to become
    compatible with a 1.5°C/2°C warming limit. This is done by comparing the energy outlooks, scenarios, and
    projections of governments, NGOs/thinktanks and private companies.
